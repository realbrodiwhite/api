# MultiOn Typescript SDK ü§ñ

A Typescript SDK for using MultiOn APIs.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with the MultiOn Typescript SDK, execute the following steps:

1. Sample program has been written in test.ts

2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`

3. Create a `secrets.json` file in the root of the project.<br>
This file should have a `MULTION_CLIENT_ID` & `MULTION_CLIENT_SECRET` key. The values for these keys can be obtained from the MultiOn team.

4. Finally, you can run the `test.ts` in two ways:
   - To run it without logs:
     ```bash
     npm run test
     ```
   - To run it with logs to see what's happening behind the scenes:
     ```bash
     npm run test:verbose
     ```
